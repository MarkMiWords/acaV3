        <h2>What is A Captive Audience?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Placeholder:</strong> A short, clear statement of purpose. What the project is.
          What it is not. Who it's for. Why it matters.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Placeholder:</strong> Formerly incarcerated people, justice-affected writers,
          and anyone who needs a focused, supportive writing environment — especially under constraint.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Why the Forge exists</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Placeholder:</strong> Writing is hard. Tools are often expensive, cluttered, or built
          for people who already have advantages. The Forge is designed to lower barriers without stealing voice.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>How the Forge will work</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Placeholder:</strong> The Forge will be a guided workspace (not a chatbot) that helps you
          write, revise, and prepare work for publication. AI assists, but never authors.

      <h2>The Forge: Coming online in stages</h2>

        <strong>Placeholder:</strong> This section will outline the planned features in plain language:
        WRAP (Write • Revise • Articulate • Publish), Sheets, local-first storage, and safe guardrails.

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Stable writing space + local-first Sheets.</li>

        <li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Publishing formats (newspaper / Substack / manuscript).</li>
